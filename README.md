# LegoTrains

A text-UI (TUI) app to teach Python programming via controlling Lego Powered Up trains.


## Installing Pre-requisites

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Technical Notes

We are using pylgbst ("Python Lego Boost") to connect to the Lego Powered Up hubs.

We need to install the latest from GitHub - the current version on PyPi does not support the latest Bleak library.
